# MBPS data required to run scripts in this repository

Files:

Note, files with 'bigTable' in the name contain tables of processed methylation data from MBPS, exported from MethPanel (https://github.com/thinhong/MethPanel). Tables comprise methylation percent values (".ratio") and coverage (".cov") for each CpG site (rows) and each sample (columns).


"bigTable1.tsv" - tsv file of processed methylation data from MBPS run 1

"bigTable1_fullRead_1000.tsv" - tsv file of processed CACNA2D4 methylation data from MBPS run 1, downsampled to 1,000 reads

"bigTable1_fullRead_10000.tsv" - tsv file of processed CACNA2D4 methylation data from MBPS run 1, downsampled to 10,000 reads

"bigTable1_fullRead_100000.tsv" - tsv file of processed CACNA2D4 methylation data from MBPS run 1, downsampled to 50,000 reads

"bigTable1_fullRead_50000.tsv" - tsv file of processed CACNA2D4 methylation data from MBPS run 1, downsampled to 100,000 reads

"bigTable2.tsv" - tsv file of processed methylation data from MBPS run 2

"bigTable2_fullRead_1000.tsv" - tsv file of processed CACNA2D4 methylation data from MBPS run 2, downsampled to 1,000 reads
